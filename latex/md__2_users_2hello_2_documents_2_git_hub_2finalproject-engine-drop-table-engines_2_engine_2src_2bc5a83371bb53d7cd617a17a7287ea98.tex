Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I\textquotesingle{}m quite dizzy with anticipation . . . Or is it the wind?

There really is a lot of that now, isn\textquotesingle{}t there? And wow! Hey! What\textquotesingle{}s this thing suddenly coming toward me very fast? Very, very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide-\/sounding name like . . . ow . . . ound . . . round . . . ground! That\textquotesingle{}s it! That\textquotesingle{}s a good name-\/ ground!

I wonder if it will be friends with me?
