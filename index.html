        <h2>Game and Game Engine Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! Our game engine is focused on <b>rhythm games,</b> a genre of game that focuses heavily on music and performing actions accurate to the rhythm of provided music.</p>
        <p>Our GUI is constructed in Typescript using React.js and electron.</p>
        <p>Because we have a music-centered idea, our engine allows for MIDI input, through use of the PortMidi library (needs to be installed separately).</p>
        <p>Please do note that one of our dependencies, DerelictPortMidi, is currently incompatible with posix-based systems, although it does compile on Mac and Windows. We have made a pull request for the package to fix this issue, but this is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon due to the last commit being six years ago.</p>

        <h2>Part 5: Post Mortem</h2>
        <p>Given more time, we think we could have done more with the MIDI capabilities of the project. MIDI input also allows for velocity data, how hard the note was pressed, and incorporating this data into a game would have been interesting and worthwhile.</p>
        <p>This documentation website could also be polished up a bit more :)</p>
